Hi everyone, here is Mingyang (Rayna), a postgraduate student in Trinity College Dublin.

This project is about a restaurant recommendation system based in Dublin city center.

It is a project built with my classmate Letian, Cian and Killian

Many thanks to our teacher Nina who supported us during the whole project and to my teammates who helped me a lot in this project.
